# Hello, my name is Danilo Bodden

I'm a Computer Engineering B.S. student (expected May 2026) and a Cybersecurity M.S. student (expected May 2027) at Florida International University.

I have hands-on experience in **digital forensics**, **secure systems analysis**, and **machine learning–based threat detection**. My current work focuses on developing ML-driven approaches to detect and mitigate **adversarial behavior in AI systems**, with an emphasis on AI safety and cybersecurity applications.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of **AI and cybersecurity**, including adversarial ML, secure system design, and real-world security engineering. I also enjoy applying technical solutions to practical problems, including software projects that support my family’s business.

My long-term goal is to become a **Security Engineer and Researcher**, contributing to the defense of modern systems against evolving cyber threats and emerging technologies.
